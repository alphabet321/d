Sure, I can walk you through the steps of implementing an Artificial Neural Network for the XOR logic gate with 2-bit binary input.

The XOR logic gate is a binary gate that outputs a 1 if the two inputs are different, and a 0 if the inputs are the same. Here is a truth table for the XOR gate with 2-bit binary inputs:

Input A	Input B	Output
0	0	0
0	1	1
1	0	1
1	1	0
To implement an Artificial Neural Network for the XOR logic gate with 2-bit binary input, we can use a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer. Here are the steps to implement this network:

Step 1: Define the input layer
The input layer will have two input nodes, one for each bit of the input.

Step 2: Define the hidden layer
The hidden layer will have two hidden nodes. We can use the sigmoid activation function for the hidden nodes.

Step 3: Define the output layer
The output layer will have one output node, which will represent the output of the XOR gate. We can also use the sigmoid activation function for the output node.

Step 4: Define the weights and biases
We need to initialize the weights and biases for the neural network. We can randomly initialize the weights and biases for each node.

Step 5: Define the training data
We need to define the training data for the neural network. In this case, the training data will consist of the four possible input combinations for the XOR gate (00, 01, 10, 11) and their corresponding outputs (0, 1, 1, 0).

Step 6: Train the neural network
We can train the neural network using backpropagation. We can start with a small learning rate and gradually increase it as the network improves.

Step 7: Test the neural network
We can test the neural network by feeding in each of the four possible input combinations and checking if the output matches the expected output from the truth table.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
